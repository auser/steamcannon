  <title>What is SteamCannon?</title>

  <para>SteamCannon is a JavaEE and Ruby Platform-as-a-Service
  (PaaS). It provides a consistent platform for your applications
  regardless of the underlying public or private cloud. Your
  applications are deployed on <ulink
  url="http://www.jboss.org/mod_cluster">mod_cluster</ulink>, <ulink
  url="http://www.jboss.org/jbossas/">JBoss AS</ulink> w/ <ulink
  url="http://torquebox.org">TorqueBox</ulink>, and <ulink
  url="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</ulink> with
  unrestricted access to all APIs.</para>

  <para>The user-facing portion of SteamCannon is a Rails application
  that can be run locally or in the cloud. It's used to start, stop,
  and configure the environments that applications are deployed
  to.</para>

    <title>Terminology</title>

    <section>
      <title>Organization</title>
      <para>
        An organization is a collection of users that all share a
        common set of Amazon credentials. When a new user requests an
        invite or registers for an account, a new organization is
        created and that user is flagged as the administrator of that
        organization. The administrator can then invite other users
        into the organization and these additional users will not be
        prompted to enter Amazon credentials to use SteamCannon. The
        administrator can also promote or demote other users in the
        organization to administrator status.

    <section>
      <title>Artifact</title>
      <para>
        An artifact is a deployable file. Examples of valid Java
        artifacts would be war files, ear files, jar files, and
        datasources. Valid Ruby artifacts would be .rails archives,
        *-rack.yml deployment descriptors, or any other type supported
        by TorqueBox.
      </para>

    <section>
      <title>Service</title>
      <para>
        A service is the smallest building block of a
        platform. SteamCannon currently has three services -
        mod_cluster, JBoss AS, and PostgreSQL.
      </para>

    <section>
      <title>Image</title>
      <para>
        An image is a virtual machine that provides one or more
        services. SteamCannon's images are created by <ulink
        url="http://www.jboss.org/boxgrinder">BoxGrinder</ulink> from
        the <ulink
        url="http://github.com/steamcannon/steamcannon-appliances/">steamcannon-appliances</ulink>
        repository.
      </para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Platform</title>
    <para>
      A platform is a predefined collection of 1 - N images shared by
      all users of SteamCannon. SteamCannon currently ships with three
      platforms - JBoss Developer Instance, JBoss 2-Tier, and JBoss
      3-Tier.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Environment</title>
    <para>
      An environment is an instance of a platform and the thing that
      artifacts are deployed into. A user can have many environments
      from multiple platforms. For example, you might have a
      Development environment based off of the developer platform and
      QA and Production environments based off of the 3-Tier Platform.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Instance</title>

    <para>
      An instance represents a running image. One or more instances is
      contained in every running environment. When an environment is
      started a configurable number of instances is started for each
      image in the environment's platform. When an environment is
      stopped, all running instances in that environment are stopped.
