Before running the app, first create RAILS_ROOT/config/steamcannon.yml

The only required setting in steamcannon.yml is your deltacloud_url:
    # Required, url of the deltacloud-core server
    deltacloud_url:  http://localhost:8080/deltacloud/api

See RAILS_ROOT/config/steamcannon.yml.example for more options.

Then setup the database schema and load seed data:
  $ rake db:setup

Make sure you're running at least version 0.0.7.2 of steamcannon-deltacloud-core
(the server to which steamcannon connects). It's recommended to deploy deltacloud
into your TB using a deltacloud-rack.yml similar to below:

---
application:
  RACK_ROOT: $TORQUEBOX_HOME/jruby/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/steamcannon-deltacloud-core-0.0.7.2-java
  RACK_ENV: production
web:
  context: /deltacloud
environment:
  API_DRIVER: ec2
