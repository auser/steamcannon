Some random notes about releasing

Build all platform images and test SC appliances several days before
the release to work out any kinks. Be sure to test migrating a copy of
the data from try.steamcannon.org to a newer AMI to work out any
migration issues.

Appliances are built using a 32bit (ami-b344b3da) and a 64bit
(ami-7543b41c) SC-meta appliance.
  - For faster appliance creation, launch c1.medium and c1.xlarge.
  - yum update libguestfs augeas-libs

Make sure all appliances are built in the steamcannon-appliances
bucket.

Make sure all appliances have version 0.2.0 in their bucket URL (so
version 0, release 2.0?)

Mark all appliance AMIs as public.

Ensure SC Vmware appliances has appropriate filename -
steamcannon-0.2.0-vmware.tgz or similar.

Upload the SC VMware appliance to steamcannon-releases bucket.

Tag steamcannon, steamcannon-agent, steamcannon-appliances for release

Add the release info to steamcannon.org/_config/releases.yml

Ensure versions in all docs/**/pom.xml are correct
