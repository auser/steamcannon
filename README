Before running the app, first create RAILS_ROOT/config/steamcannon.yml

The only required setting in steamcannon.yml is your deltacloud_url:
    # Required, url of the deltacloud-core server
    deltacloud_url:  http://localhost:3001/api

See RAILS_ROOT/config/steamcannon.yml.example for more options.

Then setup the database schema and load seed data:
  $ rake db:setup

Make sure you're running at least version 0.0.3 of deltacloud-core
(the server to which ctjr connects)
