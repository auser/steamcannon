# Database

SteamCannon uses PostgreSQL as its database and has only been tested with
version 8.4.x. By default we expect steamcannon_dev, steamcannon_test, and
steamcannon_production databases and a steamcannon user. Look at
config/database.yml and modify as needed for your environment.

1. Install Postgres 8.4
2. Run bin/setup_db.sh  
3. rake db:setup


# Configuration

Before running the app, first create RAILS_ROOT/config/steamcannon.yml

The only required setting in steamcannon.yml is your deltacloud_url:
    # Required, url of the deltacloud-core server
    deltacloud_url:  http://localhost:8080/deltacloud/api

See RAILS_ROOT/config/steamcannon.yml.example for more options.

# Deltacloud

Make sure you're running at least version 0.0.7.2 of steamcannon-deltacloud-core
(the server to which steamcannon connects). It's recommended to deploy deltacloud
into your TB using a deltacloud-rack.yml similar to below (change the jruby path)

---
application:
  RACK_ROOT: /path/to/jruby/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/steamcannon-deltacloud-core-0.0.7.2-java
  RACK_ENV: production
web:
  context: /deltacloud
environment:
  API_DRIVER: ec2
