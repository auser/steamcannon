Before running the app, first create $RAILS_ROOT/config/cooling-tower.yml

Its contents should look something like this:
    # Required, url of the deltacloud-core server
    deltacloud_url:  http://localhost:3001/api

    # Optional, defaults to 'default'
    key_pair_name: YOUR_KEY_PAIR_NAME
    
    # Optional, as long as you have working ~/.ssh/config
    ssh_private_key_file: /Users/YOU/.ssh/YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY.pem
    ssh_username: root
    
    # Optional, unless you're using latest EAP instances
    deploy_dir: /opt/jboss-eap-5.0.1/jboss-as/server/cluster-ec2/farm/

Then setup the database schema and load seed data:
  $ rake db:setup

Make sure you're running at least version 0.0.3 of deltacloud-core
(the server to which ctjr connects)
