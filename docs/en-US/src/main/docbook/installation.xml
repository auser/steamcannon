    <title>Amazon AMI</title>

    <para>
      To run SteamCannon on Amazon EC2, start an instance of
      ${ami.us-east} in the us-east-1 region. The c1.medium instance
      size is recommended; m1.small may also be used but will take
      much longer to boot. SteamCannon does not support t1.micro at
      this time. Make sure the instance is started in a security group
      that allows tcp traffic over port 8080.
    </para>

  <section>
    <title>VMware Appliance</title>

    <para>
      To run SteamCannon in a desktop VMware product (Fusion,
      Workstation, Player) <ulink
      url="http://steamcannon.org/download/">download</ulink> the
      VMware Appliance for version ${project.version}. Extract the
      downloaded .tgz file and open steamcannon.vmx in VMware. The
      root user's password is 'boxgrinder'.
    </para>

  <section>
    <title>Create a New User</title>

    <para>
      Open http://ip_address_of_appliance:8080 in your web browser and
      click the Register link under the Login button to create a new
      user. All appliances are configured for open registration,
      meaning anyone that can access the SteamCannon running on that
      appliance can create an account.

  <section>
    <title>Enter AWS Credentials</title>

    <para>
      After registering, you'll be prompted to enter your Amazon Web
      Services (AWS) credentials. If you don't already have
      credentials, you'll need to <ulink
      url="http://aws.amazon.com/">sign up</ulink> for an AWS
      account. Note that Amazon places very low quotas on
      newly-created AWS accounts so you may have to wait several hours
      after registering to successfully start an environment.
